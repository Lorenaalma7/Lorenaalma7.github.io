    <h3> About our cause </h3>
    <p> Let’s face it. We all want life to go back to normal. After more than a year on lockdown, who wouldn’t want to get out and explore the world again? If there’s one surefire way to get back to normal as soon as possible, it’s by vaccinating. That’s why we created Give It A Shot. </p>
    <h3> 

      <img id = "sign" src = assets/sign.png alt= "a sign on the highway announcing the importance of COVID-19">
Our Mission... </h3>
<p> Is to educate others about the importance of vaccinating and the dangers of choosing not to. We want our lives to go back to normal, and it is up to each individual to make the choice to vaccinate and give us our lives back. We hope that people will hear our plea and use the resources provided in this website to make the choice to vaccinate. It's up to you to give it a shot!
